# Flutter Todo App


Testing Flutter Applications

Don't forget to test your Dart Code
Testing is one of the most important things during the software development.

One of the beauty of the Dart Ecosystem, is the way developers can easily test their code.


 * ### Flutter has 3 types of tests:
    * Unit tests use block testing.
    * End to End Testing use Test Driver
    * Integration with the Test Rail library to extract the reports of the End to End Testing

 * ### By the current end to end tests, we were:
    * Verifying that the home screen is presented
    * Verifying that the user can add new todo item successfully and presented in the list
    * Verifying that the user can mark any todo item as done successfully, and the item updated in the list
    * Verifying that the user can delete any todo item successfully, and the list then updated.
